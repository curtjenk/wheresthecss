# Image Gallery 

Just a simple gallery of images created on Day 2 of school at DigitalCrafts. Practiced styling so images would appear orderly.  Instructor provided the HTML and snapshots of the expected page. We are to write the css.

I included the instructor's css in order to compare to mine.  Boy, does mine stink!  Lessons learned: 

1.  I didn't bother to look at the size of the images.  The instructor's css seems to take into account foreknowledge that the portrait image file is much larger than the landscape images.

2.  I didn't think about using media queries.  I use px instead of % which won't work great for responsive design.

3.  I had read on the web that display: inline-block is better than float: left.  So, I replaced float: left with display:inline-block in the instructor's css and did not get the desired results.

File named styles2.css was created by taking rules one-by-one from the instructor's css just to study the impact and better understand.
